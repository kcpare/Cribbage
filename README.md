# Cribbage
### Objective
An implementation of a multiplayer cribbage game in order to gain experience with Git and Github as well as exercise skills in networking and development. An external server is used to facilitate the game for participating players.

### Current Progress
All desired functionality and services are being implemented without a GUI at this time in order to focus on developing the client-server model. Once these have been achieved, a GUI will be implemented. For this reason, as stands, the game currently functions as a primitive chatbox with a built-in game of cribbage, orchestrated at the console.
